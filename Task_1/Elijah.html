            <h2>Elijah Mikaelson</h2>
            <p>Elijah Mikaelson, from The Vampire Diaries and The Originals, is one of the Original vampires known for his honor, elegance, and calm demeanor. Often referred to as the "noble" Mikaelson, Elijah is deeply committed to his family, always striving to keep them united despite their turbulent history. He values loyalty, upholds promises, and seeks redemption for his family's violent past. With a refined and strategic approach, Elijah contrasts his siblings' more impulsive nature, but beneath his composed exterior, he harbors intense emotions and a deep sense of responsibility.</p>
