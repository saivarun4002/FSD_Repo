            <h2>Stefan Salvatore</h2>
            <p>Stefan Salvatore, the brooding vampire with a heart of gold from The Vampire Diaries, is defined by his compassion, selflessness, and inner struggle with his dark side. Known as the “good” Salvatore brother, Stefan constantly battles his bloodlust, striving to protect those he loves while maintaining his humanity. Though quiet and introspective, he’s a fiercely loyal friend and a loving partner, always willing to sacrifice his happiness for the greater good. Stefan’s journey is one of redemption, torn between his past sins and the quest to find peace in a world of chaos.</p>
