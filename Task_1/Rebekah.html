            <h2>Rebekah Mikaelson</h2>
            <p>Rebekah Mikaelson, a character from The Vampire Diaries and The Originals, is one of the Original vampires. She is fiercely loyal to her family, especially her brothers, but longs for a normal human life filled with love and happiness. Rebekah is strong-willed, independent, and often struggles with her desire for love versus her family's chaotic history. Despite her tough exterior, she has a vulnerable side, craving acceptance and a chance at the life she's always dreamed of.</p>
